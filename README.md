# The rev.ng binary analysis framework and decompiler

Welcome to the [rev.ng](https://rev.ng) project!

rev.ng is an open source binary analysis framework based on LLVM and QEMU.
It features a full-fledged decompiler.
It's developed by [rev.ng Labs](https://rev.ng/about) in the open.

This repository contains the source code of the rev.ng decompiler. You can find the source of the rev.ng infrastructure and of the lifter in the [`revng` repository](https://github.com/revng/revng).
Eventually, these two repositories will be merged.
